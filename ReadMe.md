# LynAttendance

LynAttendance is a terminal based tool to "scan" through the student portal to compile information about your total attendance which calculates your attendance rate.
This is done by sending requests to the student portal which only returns the your attendence one week at a time which is a limitation due to the layout of the site. 
This program then uses the structure of the site to extract and compile the attendence information.

>> üîß IMPORTANT! : My code here does not follow the best coding practices as it was one of the first projects I have worked on, but it does leave a point in time where I can look back at to see how far I have come.
